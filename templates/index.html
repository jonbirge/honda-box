<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>This site makes it easy to move pictures from your phone or computer to your
  car. It appropriately scales and crops any photo youprovide based on your model
  and makes it available in a folder only you can access. You can then download
  the photos directly to your car from this site over the internet
  (after some initial setup). For more information:

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>I created this website mostly for my own use, but decided to make it
available publicly in case others might find it useful. I'm happy to hear about
any issues or suggestions for improvements, but can't guarantee I'll be able to
respond. You can reach me at
