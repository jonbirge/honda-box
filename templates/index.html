<h1>Honda Box</h1>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>This site was created to make it easy to upload pictures of your own to
  your Honda to use as background images. It appropriately scales and crops
  any photo you provide, and then makes the new photo available on the internet
  so you can easily download it to your car using the build-in browser.
</p>
<p>Didn't know your car had a web browser? It is probably disabled. If so,
  follow the instructions in the first video below to bring it back.
  Your car may already have access to the internet, either via
  the onboard cell connection or your phone. I recommend just enabling the
  browser (via the first video) and seeing if you have a connection. If
  you don't, then follow the instructions in the second video to connect
  to WiFi.

  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/4tw84bjbI8g" target="_blank">Honda WiFi connection</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please don't do any of this while driving, obviously.
  If you don't want to mess with any of this, you can
  just download the background files you create with this site
  and use a USB stick, per the instructions that came with your car.
</p>
<h2>Existing background images</h2>
<p>A few free images suitable for use as a background</p>
<p><ul>
  <li><a href="data/static/nature">Nature</a></li>
  <li><a href="data/static/cities">Cities</a></li>
  <li><a href="data/static/colors">Colors</a></li>
</ul></p>
<h2>Upload your own images</h2>
<p>You can <a href="upload">upload your own images</a>. They will be
  processed to fit the size and shape of the screen on your Honda and will be
  <a href="box">stored on the server</a> for you to download directly
  to your car later.
