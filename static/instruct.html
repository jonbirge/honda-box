<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>You can download your pictures to your car's
infotainment system via one of two ways: </p>

<h3>Method 1: In-car browser</h3>

<p>The easiest way is to just download the pictures directly from the
internet onto your car's system. After uploading your picture to HondaBox,
you'll be able to go back to HondaBox from the web browser in your car to
download a scaled version suitable for your in dash display.</p>

<p>Some Hondas come from the factory with a browser enabled. On more recent
models, Honda has disabled the browser. If you don't have access to the web
browser (or don't know what I'm talking about), follow the
instructions in the second video below to bring it back. Of course, you'll also
need internet access in the car. Surprisingly, your car may already have access
to the internet, via HondaLink. You can try just enabling the browser (via the
second video) and see if you have a connection. If you don't, then follow the
instructions in the first video to connect to WiFi.</p>
  
<p>I believe everything will work at least on Clarity and Civic, which use
the older version of the infotainment system. I am not sure about newer versions
as used in the current Pilot and Accord. Please let me know at webmaster@hondabox.net
if something doesn't work, or you know of any better videos.</p>

<p>I know this is a lot of setup, but once you've done it once, you never have
to do it again! You can create a bookmark on one of your home screens, and from
then on you don't have to go through any of the setup and will have a really
easy and quick way to move media from your phone or computer to your car.</p>

<h3>Method 2: USB stick</h3>

<p>If you don't want to mess with the first method, most Honda models will
allow you to upload background pictures via a USB stick.
You can always download the processed images from this website to your computer
and then copy to a USB stick. Consult your car's user manual for instructions on
how to upload pictures from the USB stick to your car. Let me know if you need
help on this and I'll be happy to find a video (or make one) showing how to do
so.</p>
